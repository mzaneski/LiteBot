# LiteBot
A slimmed-down version of my personal Discord bot for Python 3.6.7 with 80% of the commands removed. It's a decent example/template for making future bots. It just needs a bot token filled out at the top of the script to run.

## Commands
```
'listcmds' - Lists all commands.
'prefix' - Changes the command prefix. Admin only.
'nickme' - Changes the nickname of the bot for the server. Admin only.
'roll' - Rolls a number in the range provided, or 0 to 1.
'coin' - Flips heads or tails.
'blame' - Pings somebody in the server.
'ball' - 8ball fortune telling.
'choose' - Chooses a random option from a set of input choices.
'spam' - Converts ASCII letters to discord emojis.
```

## Dependencies
discord.py
`python3 -m pip install -U discord`
